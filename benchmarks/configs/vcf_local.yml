# VCF Benchmark Configuration (Local Use Only)
# 
# This configuration is for local benchmarking with downloaded VCF files.
# VCF benchmarks are NOT included in CI/CD due to large file sizes.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Download VCF files: ./benchmarks/scripts/download_vcf_benchmark_files.sh
# 2. Update file paths below to match your download location
# 3. Run: ./target/release/benchmark-runner benchmarks/configs/vcf_local.yml
#
# See benchmarks/VCF_BENCHMARKS.md for detailed instructions

format: vcf
table_name: variants

# Local file paths (update these after downloading)
# Use absolute paths to downloaded VCF files
test_data:
  # Recommended: Use medium file (~2-3MB) for reasonable benchmark duration
  # For quick tests, use: /tmp/small_trio_ychr.vcf.gz (~50KB)
  # For comprehensive tests, use: /tmp/large_chr22_phase3.vcf.gz (~200-300MB)
  - filename: /tmp/medium_ceu_genotypes.vcf.gz
    # Note: drive_url is ignored for absolute paths but required by schema
    drive_url: https://local-file
    checksum: null
