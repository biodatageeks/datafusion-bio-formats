# GFF3 Benchmark Configuration
# This configuration defines benchmarks for the GFF3 file format using gencode.49 test data

# Parallelism benchmarks - test BGZF parallel decompression
# Tests with different thread counts to measure parallel speedup

# Predicate pushdown benchmarks - test filter optimization efficiency
# Each test measures how well filters are pushed down to reduce data scanning
